  "content": "Statistics is the study of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. You'll learn about different ways to represent data (like graphs and charts), measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), and measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation). Statistics helps us make sense of the world around us and draw conclusions from data.",
